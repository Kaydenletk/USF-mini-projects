### Problem 1.1: Simple Program Structure (4 points)
Write a complete C++ program that:
- Includes necessary headers
- Has a main function
- Prints "Hello, Data Structures!" to the console
- Returns 0

### Problem 1.2: Fundamental Types (4 points)
Declare and initialize variables of the following types with appropriate values:
```cpp
// Complete the following:
a) An integer to store age
b) A double to store GPA
c) A char to store a grade letter
d) A boolean to check if enrolled
e) A string to store student name
```

### Problem 1.3: Pointers Basics (6 points)
Given:
```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;
```
What will be the output of:
a) `cout << x;`
b) `cout << &x;`
c) `cout << ptr;`
d) `cout << *ptr;`
e) After executing `*ptr = 20;`, what is the value of x?

### Problem 1.4: Arrays (6 points)
Write code to:
a) Declare an array of 5 integers
b) Initialize it with values {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
c) Print the third element
d) Change the last element to 100
e) Calculate and print the sum of all elements

## Section 2: Expressions and Casting (15 points)

### Problem 2.1: Basic Expressions (5 points)
Evaluate the following (show your work):
```cpp
a) int result = 17 / 5;        // result = ?
b) double result = 17.0 / 5;   // result = ?
c) int x = 5; x = x++ + ++x;   // x = ?
d) int a = 10, b = 20; int c = (a > b) ? a : b;  // c = ?
```

### Problem 2.2: Type Casting (10 points)
Complete the following conversions:
```cpp
a) Convert int 65 to char (what character?)
b) Convert double 9.99 to int (what value?)
c) Convert char '5' to int (what value?)
d) static_cast vs C-style cast - explain the difference
e) When would you use reinterpret_cast?
```

## Section 3: Control Flow (20 points)

### Problem 3.1: If-Else Statements (6 points)
Write a program that takes a numeric grade (0-100) and prints the letter grade:
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 0-59

### Problem 3.2: Loops (8 points)
Write three different versions to print numbers 1 to 10:
a) Using a for loop
b) Using a while loop
c) Using a do-while loop

### Problem 3.3: Switch Statements (6 points)
Write a menu system using switch that:
- Takes a number 1-4
- Prints different messages for each choice
- Handles invalid input with default case

---

## Section 4: Functions (25 points)

### Problem 4.1: Basic Function (5 points)
Write a function `int square(int n)` that returns the square of n.

### Problem 4.2: Pass by Value vs Reference (8 points)
Write two functions:
a) `void swapByValue(int a, int b)` - attempts to swap
b) `void swapByReference(int& a, int& b)` - successfully swaps

Explain why one works and the other doesn't.

### Problem 4.3: Function Overloading (7 points)
Write three overloaded `max` functions:
```cpp
a) int max(int a, int b)
b) double max(double a, double b)
c) int max(int a, int b, int c)
```

### Problem 4.4: Default Parameters (5 points)
Write a function `void printMessage(string msg, int times = 1)` that prints a message n times.

---

## Section 5: Classes and Objects (20 points)

### Problem 5.1: Basic Class (8 points)
Create a `Rectangle` class with:
- Private members: width, height
- Constructor that takes width and height
- Public methods: getArea(), getPerimeter()
- Getter and setter methods

### Problem 5.2: Constructor/Destructor (6 points)
Add to the Rectangle class:
- Default constructor (sets width and height to 1)
- Copy constructor
- Destructor that prints "Rectangle destroyed"

### Problem 5.3: The Big Three (6 points)
Explain when you need:
a) Destructor
b) Copy constructor
c) Assignment operator

Give an example of a class that would need all three.

## Bonus Section: Mixed Problems (10 points)

### Bonus 1: Pointer Arithmetic (5 points)
```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int* ptr = arr;
```
What is the value of:
a) `*(ptr + 2)`
b) `ptr[3]`
c) After `ptr++;`, what does `*ptr` equal?

### Bonus 2: Dynamic Memory (5 points)
Write code to:
a) Dynamically allocate an array of 10 integers
b) Fill it with values 0-9
c) Properly deallocate the memory
